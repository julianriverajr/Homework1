# Homework 01: Code Refactor

## What I Did

In this homework assignment, we were asked to refactor a couple files of code; that is, to make them look better without changing the function, and to make elements which do not function into functioning elements.

This involved 

* renaming certain HTML elements from &lt;divs&gt; to more descriptive, semantic names

* consolidating or deleting unnecessary classes or IDs

* reorganizing the various elements into semantic structure

* renaming and consolidating CSS selectors to select the corresponding new names in the HTML

* commenting the CSS

* reorganizing selectors in CSS into semantic structure

* making sure to commit and push 

* making sure the site is live as well as the repo on github

* following the Scout Rule as much as I could
